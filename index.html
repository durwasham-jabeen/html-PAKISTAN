	<h1>MY BEAUTIFUL PAKISTAN</h1>
	<hr/><br/>
	<p> Pakistan,[c] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,[d] is a country
      in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a
      population of almost 242 million, and has the world's second-largest
      Muslim population.[13] Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area,
      spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It has a
      1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of
      Oman in the south, and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to
      the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is
      separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the
      north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.</p>
	<p> Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the
      8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan,[14] and the
      Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the
      civilisations of the Afro-Eurasia.[15][16] The region that comprises the
      modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties,
      including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the Great; the
      Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[17] the Umayyad Caliphate in
      its southern regions, the Hindu Shahis, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi
      Sultanate, the Mughals,[18] the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East
      India Company rule, and most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858
      to 1947.</p>
