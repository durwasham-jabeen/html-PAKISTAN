	<h1>KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA</h1><hr/>
	<p> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (/ˌkaɪbər pəkˈtuːŋkwə/; Pashto: خېبر پښتونخوا;
    Hindko/Urdu: خیبر پختونخوا),[4] commonly abbreviated as KP or KPK, is one
    of the four provinces of Pakistan. It is located in the northwestern
    region of the country, along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border, and the city
    of Peshawar serves as its capital.</p>
	<p>While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its
    population and its economy, it is geographically the smallest.[5] The
    province is home to 17.9 percent of Pakistan's total population, with the
    majority of its inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindkowans. Within
    Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa borders Punjab, Balochistan, the Islamabad
    Capital Territory, and the Pakistani-administered territories of
    Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
	<p> Once a stronghold of Buddhism, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the
    ancient region of Gandhara, including the ruins of the Gandharan capital
    of Pushkalavati (located near modern-day Charsadda). The region's history
    is characterized by frequent invasions by various empires, largely due to
    its geographical proximity to the historically important Khyber Pass.[6]</p>
