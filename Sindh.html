	<h1>SINDH</h1><hr/>
	<p>Sindh (/ˈsɪnd/; Sindhi: سنڌ; Urdu: سندھ, pronounced [sɪndʱ]; historically
      romanized as Sind) is one of the four provinces of Pakistan. Located in
      the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the third-largest
      province of Pakistan by total area and the second-largest province by
      population after Punjab. It shares land borders with the Pakistani
      provinces of Balochistan and Punjab to the west and north, respectively,
      and the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also
      bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly
      of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the Thar Desert in the
      eastern portion of the province along the international border with India,
      and the Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the province.</p>
	<p>The economy of Sindh is the second-largest in Pakistan after the province
      of Punjab; its provincial capital of Karachi is the most populous city in
      the country as well as its main financial hub. Sindh is home to a large
      portion of Pakistan's industrial sector and contains two of the country's
      busiest commercial seaports: Port Qasim and the Port of Karachi. The
      remainder of Sindh consists of an agriculture-based economy and produces
      fruits, consumer items and vegetables for other parts of the country.</p>
