	<h1>PUNJAB</h1><hr/>
	<p>Punjab (/pʌnˈdʒɑːb, -ˈdʒæb, ˈpʌn-/; Gurmukhi: ਪੰਜਾਬ; Shahmukhi: پنجاب;
    Punjabi: [pənˈdʒaːb] (listen); also romanised as Panjāb or Panj-Āb)[a] is
    a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia,
    specifically in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising
    areas of eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. Punjab's major cities
    are Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana,
    Amritsar, Sialkot, Chandigarh, Jalandhar and Bahawalpur.</p>
	<p>Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as
    an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley
    civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE,[10] and had numerous migrations by
    the Indo-Aryan peoples. Agriculture has been the major economic feature of
    the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture,
    with one's social status being determined by land ownership.[10] The
    Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following
    the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been
    described as the "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan."[10]</p>
